# Open_Stage_contribution

collaboration campaign with the startup OpenStage (https://theopenstage.it/en/main-home-en/) for the Project Design course.
The work carried out had the aim of researching and analyzing additional customers (and related needs) of the already developed platform,
devising an effective and scalable solution and introducing it into their business model, paying attention to the social impact and changes to the financial plan.
This work was followed by a phase of deepening and quantitative improvement of a data collection method (triading), 
showing how it would have been possible to apply it to the case study.
